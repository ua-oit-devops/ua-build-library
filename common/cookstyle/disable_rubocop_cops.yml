# By using this separate config for cookstyle and disabling all of the
# original robocop cops, here, we are able to use rubocop to perform our
# static code analysis while we use cookstyle for just its Chef specific
# cops.
#
# Besides adding Chef specific cops to rubocop, cookstyle also modifies
# rubocop's original cops to prevent them from complaining about syntax and
# features common in Chef recipes and resources.  These modifications are
# not approriate when checking actual ruby code such as that in our
# libraries and test suites and in some cases directly contradict the
# findings of rubocop's original cops, making it difficult to use both
# tools in parallel.
